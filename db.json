    "description": "The 2.5-litre turbocharged petrol engine in the flagship Mazda 6 produces 173kW and 420Nm sent to the front wheels through a six-speed automatic transmission.For 2023, the peak power output has risen by 3kW (from 170kW previously), and Mazda claims the engine produces 8Nm more torque at 4200rpm. But the changes are so minor they may not be even noticeable on a back-to-back test drive.The engine’s outputs are close to hot-hatch territory, but the engine does not like to be revved to redline like a hot hatch, and instead has a more relaxed, diesel-like character that likes to be kept at low revs.When the turbocharger has spooled up – and the transmission is in the right gear – performance is strong and makes for swift highway overtaking, accompanied by a deep and rather satisfying rumble at lower revs.",

In our testing, it went from zero to 60 mph in 3.5 seconds. The Turbo S E-Hybrid's power and performance are even more extreme. It uses the same twin-turbo V-8 from the Cayenne Turbo, but Porsche has enhanced its power with a 134-hp electric motor sandwiched between the 4.0-liter and its responsive eight-speed automatic. Total output is a mind-boggling 670 horsepower, and speeds as high as 83 mph are possible without the gas engine ever switching on. The system also can operate in a battery-saving mode that only burns gas or the two systems can work together, and its operation is exceedingly smooth. Its battery pack can complete a full recharge in about 2.5 hours when connected to a 240-volt, 30-amp source, and the SUV has a pure electric range of more than 20 miles. Did we mention it can also sprint to 60 mph in 3.2 seconds and covers the quarter-mile in 11.5 seconds at 121 mph? It's one of the quickest SUVs we've ever tested.

The old-school engine pairs up to a new-school 8-speed automatic transmission, but gas mileage is still low at 12 mpg city, 16 highway, 14 combined. Thankfully, that figure factors in the standard four-wheel drive. The six-figure LX rightfully includes standard automatic emergency braking, automatic high-beam headlights, lane-departure warnings, blind-spot monitors, and adaptive cruise control. In all its years on the market, the NHTSA and IIHS have not seen fit to crash-test the LX.Buying a Lexus LX 570 is easy: it's sold with one engine, in two trim levels, and with only a handful of options. The $87,875 MSRP includes a 12.3-inch touchscreen with navigation, four-zone climate control, power-adjustable and heated front seats, leather upholstery, a surround-view camera system, and 20-inch wheels. An adaptive suspension with height control is also standard, as is a collection of off-road equipment that encompasses multiple terrain drive modes, a trail-focused cruise control, and torque-vectoring turn-assist. Two rows of seats are standard; a three-row model costs about $5,000 more.",

    "description": "The 2017 BMW M4 high-performance coupe is all business: Dense, muscular bodywork haunches down over massive tires, an exaggerated but functional front aerodynamic appliance manages airflow, and a quartet of exhaust pipes announce the arrival of its twin-turbo inline-six engine with blaring intensity. Like the M3 sedan that it shares much of its structural and spiritual DNA with, the M4 benefits from the automaker's M performance division's work on its engine and chassis. The base M4 comes equipped with a 473-hp twin-turbo inline-six mated with a six-speed manual gearbox and rear drive—the time-honored configuration for maximum driver involvement, and BMW's decision to keep it on the books speaks volumes. The Competition trim forgoes the manual for an eight-speed automatic, but bumps output to 503 horsepower. All-wheel drive is available on the Competition and, for the 2025 model year, selecting AWD comes with a value-added bonus in the form of an additional 20 horsepower for a total of 523 ponies.The M4's suspension is tuned for performance, and it'll reward you with stupendous levels of grip on twisty backroads and track days; just know that every pothole and road imperfection will remind you of just how taught that suspension is. That—and the overly complex configurable drive modes—are two important characteristics that we think are handled with more finesse in competitors like the Cadillac CT4-V Blackwing, Mercedes-AMG C63, and Alfa Romeo Giulia Quadrifoglio.",

For the crowd that regularly needs to move metaphorical mountains, the strongest version of this heavy-duty pickup truck touts a max towing capacity of 40,000 pounds and an 8000-pound payload rating. Along with a pair of dutiful gas-fed V-8s, the Super Duty family—members include the F-250, F-350, and F-450—can be fitted with Ford's excellent Power Stroke diesel V-8. That 6.7-liter monster makes up to 500 horsepower and peaks at a class-leading 1200 pound-feet of torque. Of course, these trucks are more than huge workhorse, they can also be configured with impressive levels of luxury, including a two-tone leather interior and seats with more adjustments than a chiropractor's chair. The Super Duty's clever available tech includes a center console that turns into a desk, a bed-mounted onboard generator, and driver assists that make hauling and towing easier. Far more than the mere sum of its parts, the 2024 Super Duty can conquer almost every task, which is why we put it on our Editors' Choice list again this year.",
