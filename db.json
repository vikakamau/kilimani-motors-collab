    "description": "The 2.5-litre turbocharged petrol engine in the flagship Mazda 6 produces 173kW and 420Nm sent to the front wheels through a six-speed automatic transmission.For 2023, the peak power output has risen by 3kW (from 170kW previously), and Mazda claims the engine produces 8Nm more torque at 4200rpm. But the changes are so minor they may not be even noticeable on a back-to-back test drive.The engine’s outputs are close to hot-hatch territory, but the engine does not like to be revved to redline like a hot hatch, and instead has a more relaxed, diesel-like character that likes to be kept at low revs.When the turbocharger has spooled up – and the transmission is in the right gear – performance is strong and makes for swift highway overtaking, accompanied by a deep and rather satisfying rumble at lower revs.",

The SVR is rated at around 16.9 mpg (miles per gallon) with CO2 emissions of about 378 g/km.On the contrary, the regular Range Rover Sport, equipped with a Mild Hybrid Electric Vehicle (MHEV) system, delivers better fuel efficiency at around 30.4 mpg, with lower CO2 emissions of about 209 g/km.

    "description": " The Cayenne Turbo is powered by a 541-hp twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V-8 engine with a conventional eight-speed automatic transmission. In our testing, it went from zero to 60 mph in 3.5 seconds. The Turbo S E-Hybrid's power and performance are even more extreme. It uses the same twin-turbo V-8 from the Cayenne Turbo, but Porsche has enhanced its power with a 134-hp electric motor sandwiched between the 4.0-liter and its responsive eight-speed automatic. Total output is a mind-boggling 670 horsepower, and speeds as high as 83 mph are possible without the gas engine ever switching on. The system also can operate in a battery-saving mode that only burns gas or the two systems can work together, and its operation is exceedingly smooth. Its battery pack can complete a full recharge in about 2.5 hours when connected to a 240-volt, 30-amp source, and the SUV has a pure electric range of more than 20 miles. Did we mention it can also sprint to 60 mph in 3.2 seconds and covers the quarter-mile in 11.5 seconds at 121 mph? It's one of the quickest SUVs we've ever tested.

    "description": "As the name alludes to, the LX 570 gets its power from a 5.7-liter V-8 making 383 hp and 403 lb-ft of torque. The old-school engine pairs up to a new-school 8-speed automatic transmission, but gas mileage is still low at 12 mpg city, 16 highway, 14 combined. Thankfully, that figure factors in the standard four-wheel drive. The six-figure LX rightfully includes standard automatic emergency braking, automatic high-beam headlights, lane-departure warnings, blind-spot monitors, and adaptive cruise control. In all its years on the market, the NHTSA and IIHS have not seen fit to crash-test the LX.Buying a Lexus LX 570 is easy: it's sold with one engine, in two trim levels, and with only a handful of options. The $87,875 MSRP includes a 12.3-inch touchscreen with navigation, four-zone climate control, power-adjustable and heated front seats, leather upholstery, a surround-view camera system, and 20-inch wheels. An adaptive suspension with height control is also standard, as is a collection of off-road equipment that encompasses multiple terrain drive modes, a trail-focused cruise control, and torque-vectoring turn-assist. Two rows of seats are standard; a three-row model costs about $5,000 more.",
